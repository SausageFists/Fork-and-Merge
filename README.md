Fork and Merge cutting/SAVE ME

INT. MARCUS’ HOME. BEDROOM. EVENING.
MARCUS comes into his room and sits on the bed. We hear the fighting continue.
TISHA (O.C.)
Do you have any idea what he’s going through?
KATIE (O.C.)
Do you?
MARCUS’ phone rings with the Indigo Girls ring-tone.
Baby I'm here to stop your crying
Chase all the ghosts from your head
Multiply life by the power of two
It goes to voice mail and we hear KATIE and TISHA again.
TISHA (O.C.)
He says he got the phone.
KATIE (O.C.)
Why would that matter to you?
TISHA (O.C.)
This is hard on him.
KATIE (O.C.)
He’s got to grow up, Tisha. 
TISHA
It’s a little more than that!
KATIE
And all those pills aren’t helping anything.  
TISHA
You have no idea what you’re talking about, Katie and maybe you grow up and stop acting like you’re a teenager!
We hear the back door slam and KATIE yelling something outside. MARCUS looks at the phone. “Missed call: BILLIE”.
INT. MARCUS’ HOME. DINING ROOM. EVENING.
MARCUS and KATIE eat in silence. A third plate sits empty.
MARCUS
What if he’s got to go back?
KATIE
They’re not sending him back.
They eat. 
KATIE (CONT’D)
Not for a while at least.
MARCUS
Can we go to the base after supper?
KATIE
Let’s get the dishes done and maybe he’ll be back.
MARCUS’ HOME. BEDROOM. NIGHT.
MARCUS is lying in his bed. A crack is heard outside his window. He gets out of bed. He sees a shadow move in the yard below. Then nothing. MARCUS opens his window. Moonlight bathes the yard below. Suddenly, O LAN is standing still by the tree. They look at each other for a minute. Night sounds.
MARCUS
(whispering down)
You’re that girl.
O LAN looks at MARCUS in his pajamas.
MARCUS (CONT’D)
You came for your phone?
O LAN
Did she call you?
MARCUS
Who?
O LAN 
You really here to save us?
MARCUS is confused that she knows about that conversation.
MARCUS
It says, “Billie” and it’s got this lame ring-tone.
O LAN
“The Power of Two”.
MARCUS
Don’t know it.
O LAN
Indigo Girls were big, when we went to school.
There is a tapping on his bedroom door. 
KATIE (O.C.)
Marcus?
He looks to the door and when he looks back out the window, O LAN is gone. 
KATIE (O.C.) (CONT’D)
You awake, honey?
MARCUS closes the window and lies on the bed. The door opens and light from the hallway cuts into the darkness.
KATIE (O.C.) (CONT’D)
(whispers)
You awake? Marcus. Marcus?
MARCUS
Is he back finally?
KATIE
Don’t be mad at your dad. It’s tough right now, but your dad loves you very much. I love him too, Marcus. I hope you know that. 
MARCUS
I better get to sleep.
She sits on his bed.
KATIE
The first time I met your dad he brought me up here. You were sound asleep. In the middle of the party. We sat here and he showed me his new tatoo all up his arm. It wasn’t done but he had your name weaved with the roses. Remember? I thought he was the coolest guy. And you were his little soldier. Remember?
MARCUS doesn’t say anything.
KATIE (CONT’D)
It’s a tough to come home. He’s just got some things he’s got work out.
(pause)
Okay? 
(pause)
Marcus?
MARCUS has closed his eyes.
KATIE (CONT’D)
Honey, I...  
(silence)
Night.
She leaves quietly. The hall light goes out. Moonlight bathes the room. MARCUS gets up and goes back to the window, but O LAN is no longer by the tree.
Suddenly O LAN is right outside the open window on the roof. MARCUS almost dies of shock. 
O LAN
A little soldier?
He catches his breath.
O LAN (CONT’D)
I was way off. 
She looks in the window at his room. She looks at him in his pajamas. 
O LAN (CONT’D)
Who do you think you are? 
MARCUS
What do you mean?
O LAN
Who do you want to be?
MARCUS
I don’t know.
O LAN smiles and looks deeply into his eyes.
MARCUS (CONT’D)
You want your phone?
O LAN
It’s your phone. 
MARCUS
I don’t know Billie.
O LAN
Yeah, you do. And now you can save her. Soldier.
O LAN is now outside the window which is now closed. 
MARCUS
What?
O LAN
I can’t hear you.
MARCUS
Why were they chasing you this morning? 
O LAN
Why do they chase us every morning?
MARCUS
What?
She puts her hand on the glass.
O LAN
Savior.
MARCUS looks outside but she’s vanished. He sees only his reflection in the window.
